If your app accesses other apps' media files, request one or more of these permissions instead: @B__IMAGES_E@ READ_MEDIA_IMAGES , @B__VIDEO_E@ READ_MEDIA_VIDEO , @B__AUDIO_E@ READ_MEDIA_AUDIO . Learn more about the @B_ata-storage.shared.media#storage-permission_E@ that are associated with media files. This permission is enforced starting in API level 19. Before API level 19, this permission is not enforced and all apps still have access to read from external storage. You can test your app with the permission enforced by enabling Protect USB storage under Developer options in the Settings app on a device running Android 4.1 or higher. Also starting in API level 19, this permission is not required to read or write files in your application-specific directories returned by @B_android.content.Context#getExternalFilesDir(java.lang.String)_E@ and @B_android.content.Context#getExternalCacheDir()_E@ . Starting in API level 29, apps don't need to request this permission to access files in their app-specific directory on external storage, or their own files in the @B_android.provider.MediaStore_E@ MediaStore . Apps shouldn't request this permission unless they need to access other apps' files in the MediaStore . Read more about these changes in the @B_ata-storage#scoped-storage_E@ section of the developer documentation. If both your @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#min_E@ minSdkVersion and @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#target_E@ targetSdkVersion values are set to 3 or lower, the system implicitly grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#target_E@ targetSdkVersion is 4 or higher. This is a soft restricted permission which cannot be held by an app it its full form until the installer on record allowlists the permission. Specifically, if the permission is allowlisted the holder app can access external storage and the visual and aural media collections while if the permission is not allowlisted the holder app can only access to the visual and aural medial collections. Also the permission is immutably restricted meaning that the allowlist state can be specified only at install time and cannot change until the app is installed.

If your app is already using SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM on older SDKs but needs USE_EXACT_ALARM on SDK 33 and above, then SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM should be declared with a max-sdk attribute, like: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM\" android:maxSdkVersion=\"32\" /> Apps that hold this permission, always stay in the @B_android.app.usage.UsageStatsManager#STANDBY_BUCKET_WORKING_SET_E@ or lower standby bucket.

Note: If your app uses the @B_android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_CONTACTS_E@ permission and both your @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#min_E@ minSdkVersion and @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#target_E@ targetSdkVersion values are set to 15 or lower, the system implicitly grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your @B_cs.manifest.uses-sdk-element#target_E@ targetSdkVersion is 16 or higher. Protection level: dangerous This is a hard restricted permission which cannot be held by an app until the installer on record allowlists the permission.

Note: If your app targets @B_android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R_E@ or higher, this permission has no effect. If your app is on a device that runs API level 19 or higher, you don't need to declare this permission to read and write files in your application-specific directories returned by @B_android.content.Context#getExternalFilesDir(java.lang.String)_E@ and @B_android.content.Context#getExternalCacheDir()_E@ . Learn more about how to @B_ata-storage.shared.media#update-other-apps-files_E@ that your app doesn't own, and how to @B_ata-storage.shared.documents-files_E@ that your app doesn't own. If your app is a file manager and needs broad access to external storage files, then the system must place your app on an allowlist so that you can successfully request the @B_ERNAL_STORAGE><code translate=_E@ permission.

Note: If the app targets API level 23 or higher, the app user must explicitly grant this permission to the app through a permission management screen. The app requests the user's approval by sending an intent with action @B_android.provider.Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS_E@ . The app can check whether it has this authorization by calling @B_android.provider.Settings.System#canWrite(android.content.Context)_E@ .
